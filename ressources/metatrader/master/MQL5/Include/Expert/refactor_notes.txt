// I cannot easily edit the file due to encoding issues with the edit tools on this specific file type/encoding.
// Instead, I will provide the user with the instruction to replace the file content, or I will try to overwrite it completely if I can ensure utf-16le or compatible encoding. 
// Given the environment constraints, I will try to write a NEW file `AppClient_v2.mqh` with standard UTF-8 encoding and then rename/replace it.

// WAIT. PowerShell output showed the file content. I can try to simply OVERWRITE it with UTF-8 content.
// MQL5 supports UTF-8.

// STEPS:
// 1. Read the full content (I have most of it).
// 2. Modify `ProcessMessages` to use `GetTickCount64()`.
// 3. Modify `ParseConfigLine` to treat `pollInterval` as milliseconds (or keep seconds but multiply, but user wants 15ms).
// 4. Overwrite file.

// Let's first read the FULL file to ensure I have all methods.
